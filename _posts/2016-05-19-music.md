description: 'ROAM - Rehearsals Of Absent Mind (Live Improvised Music) Music and sound project with a firm belief in improvised music as the purest language. These are conversations of musicians, interactive compositions, written topics or totally improvised ideas that sprout in an innocent way, it is a form of meditation, of self-knowledge and experimentation, with a goal of achieving higher levels of consciousness and enjoyment for both listener and player.'
